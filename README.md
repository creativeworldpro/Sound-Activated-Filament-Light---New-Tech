The project is about making music activated light circuit. We will make that circuit, the circuit can sync with music. The lights react to sound and will flash along with the beat of music. Wrap around anything like branches, trees, or vases or bend into any shape you like for that customized look and instant magical touch.

The sound-activated lamp was developed based on the Dragon Board™ 410c, and is turned on when the sound-activated module detects sounds. After a period of time, the lamp will be turned off automatically. This is convenient and energy saving
The circuit is also able to react to the listener and the environment in real-time.


Component List - 

To make a mini music light, the circuit can be enclosed in a small plastic or metal casing with a switch to turn it on and off. A small keychain or lanyard can also be attached to the casing to make it easy to carry around.

Additional components, such as capacitors, resistors, filament bulb or transistors, can be added to the circuit to control the brightness or flashing pattern of the filament bulb.

Connect Connection - Step 1

To make this music reactive circuit, we connect BC547 transistor collector leg with Base leg of BC557 transistor. Then we connect BC547 transistor base leg with positive leg of Mic and connect BC547 transistor emitter leg with negative leg of Mic.


Connect Connection - Step 2

Now we need to connect 68 KΩ resistor with emitter leg of BC557 transistor and connect 1 KΩ resistor with base leg and emitter leg of BC557 transistor. Then connect 100 KΩ resistor with emitter leg of BC547 transistor and collector leg of BC557.


Connect Connection - Step 3

This time we need to connect BC557 transistor collector leg with 14 leg of CD-4017 IC and connect 4no and 15no leg of CD-4017 IC.

It is time to connect CD-4017 IC 13no leg with emitter leg of BC547 transistor. We also need to connect 13no and 8no leg of CD-4017 IC.

Our circuit is now completely ready for use. Now need to connect a Triac with the circuit. Connect triac “T1” terminal with 8no leg of CD-4017 IC.


Connect Connection - Step 4

Now we need to connect a 220 Ω resistor with the circuit. We connect this resistor with 2no leg of CD-4017 IC and connect its other terminal with “G” terminal of triac. Since it is an AC bulb music active circuit, for that we need to connect an AC bulb with the circuit.

Connect AC bulb one terminal with “T2” terminal of triac and AC bulb other terminal with 220 volt AC line.


Connect Connection - Step 5

Then connect AC voltage other terminal with 8no leg of CD-4017 IC. Now need to connect DC-9v power supply with the circuit. We connect DC-9v positive cable with “Emitter” leg of BC557 transistor and DC-9v negative cable with 13no leg CD-417 IC.

Now just, plug-in power and put Mic beside the sound system and connect AC bulb with the holder. Enjoy the effect of music reactive light circuit.

Again thanks to JLCPCB for best quality PCBs.


Soldering And Cleaning - 

Neat and perfect soldering is an important part for all kind of PCBs. Since soldering, you should remember that, there should not be any kind of short circuit connection. After soldering all leg, we cut-off the extra leg of all electronics component.

We also can use liquid PCB cleaner to clean the PCB board.


Final Action - 

Our circuit is completely ready for use now. We need to power switch ON and put audio source beside MIC. Then play music and enjoy the awesome effect of filament bulb.
