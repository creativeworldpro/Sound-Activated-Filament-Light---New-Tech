# Sound-Activated-Filament-Light---New-Tech
The project is about making music activated light circuit. We will make that circuit, the circuit can sync with music. The lights react to sound and will flash along with the beat of music. Wrap around anything like branches, trees, or vases or bend into any shape you like for that customized look and instant magical touch.
